### Acknowledgment
Based on [Ying Jin, Emmanuel J. Cand√®s 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01408), using code from their [simulation project](https://github.com/ying531/selcf_paper).
### Aescription
A python package for applying the Benjamini-Hochberg algorithm over conformal prediction.
This project aims to provide an easy way to control the False Detection Rate (FDR) of predicting with a model.
